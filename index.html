                    <p>As the CBI took over the Odisha train accident investigation, authorities in Odisha began
                        addressing the challenge of identifying unclaimed bodies of the deceased. The central probe
                        agency was roped in after a preliminary inquiry flagged tampering with the electronic
                        interlocking system, which detects the presence of trains, and officials suspected “sabotage”
                        behind the Friday accident.</p>
